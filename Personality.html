                <p>My Hero is my mom. I chose her because she is the ultimate superhero to me, she shows me day after day that women can do anything they put their minds to. She encourages me to always do my best. She makes many sacrifices to make sure that her children are okay and sheâ€™s always there to lend a hand. She is my ultimate motivator, my confidant and my best friend.</p>

            <div class="reflection">
                <p>While my report highlights a broad range of career options, the scores suggest a good fit for roles that combine analytical thinking, technical expertise, and a balance between independent and team-based work. I think some of the IT-related roles, such as computer animator, software developer, or technical support, align well with my personality traits, and prove that I might enjoy careers that allows me to solve problems, work at my own pace, and collaborate in a relaxed, low-stress environment.</p>
